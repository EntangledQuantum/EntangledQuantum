### 🔭 Currently Building

🚀 **Physics-Aware AI Systems**  
> Integrating physics-informed learning with high-fidelity simulation to create AI that *understands cause and effect* in the real world.

🤖 **Autonomous Robotics & Smart Manufacturing**  
> Building digital-twin-driven robotics platforms — adaptive, simulation-native systems that evolve continuously.

🧩 **Simulation Infrastructure**  
> Leveraging **Isaac Sim / Isaac Lab**, **NVIDIA Omniverse**, and **PhysicsNeMo** to enable scalable, differentiable, physics-based simulation pipelines.

### 🌌 Philosophy

> "The next leap in intelligence isn’t digital—it’s **physical**."  

I believe the future belongs to systems that **learn through physics**, **adapt through simulation**, and **build through iteration** — technology that evolves as naturally as life itself.

### 🌍 Vision

A future where **AI, robotics, and simulation converge** —  
where factories learn, design, and build autonomously across Earth and space.  
Not automation. Evolution.
